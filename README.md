# Development-of-Statistical-Techniques-for-Points-Per-Game-PPG-Prediction
Predicting the Points Per Game (PPG) of football players offers an interesting challenge dueto the popularity of the sport.As a result, together with the PPG, predicting the outcomesof football matches is a challenging task due to the large number of parameters that mustbe considered and which cannot be measured or estimated quantitatively.Many approacheshave historically used the number of goals scored by each player to forecast the PPG ofprofessional athletes,  which would have been useful in estimating potential results andevaluating the players success.Instead of using the number of goals scored by the players,this study investigates various machine learning techniques for predicting the PPG of footballplayers considering specific factors such as age, best position, capacity, and so on.Ratherthan using the actual amount of goals scored, a model is constructed to aid us in determiningthe best player, greatest league, preferred step, and relationship between team rankings andplayer performance in this study.This method was combined with a measurement of manyaspects of a football team’s players, such as age, best position, nationality, and so on, whichhave been maintained after every match and used to construct a model that forecasts theplayers’ PPG, as well as determine the best overall athlete, preferred foot, biggest club,relationship between player skill and overall ratings, and so on.For this project, I createdone feature vector that I used on our four machine learning techniques: Linear Regression,Random Forest Regressor, Elastic Net Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor.On the basis of aminimum error value, all of the models were evaluated.
